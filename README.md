# Robotic-Manipulator-v17
The Main Rover is equipped with a Robotic Arm placed at the front of the chassis which is designed to perform various scientific tasks. 
The arm consists of 3 basic joints- base, shoulder and elbow. 
Each joint is equipped with a harmonic drive reducer of ratio for high torque capacity, excellent positioning accuracy, low backlash, and high torsional stiffness.
Base and shoulder joints of the arm have a high reduction ratio of 160:1 to meet the required torque.
BLDC motors with FOC control are used to actuate the mechanical joints while hall encoders provide closed-loop feedback for each joint.
To cut down on redundant components, and to increase modularity the end effectors have been made swappable to reduce the instantaneous torque requirements of the robotic arm.

Drill module: 
The drill module comprises a collet chuck, allowing for rapid tool changes. 36 core sampling drill bits allow isolated core samples to be collected, minimizing cross-contamination. 
Three linear actuators at the corners of the drill module provide stability while drilling across a wide range of surface topographies.

Camera and Raman spectrometer module: 
The science module comprises of a Raman Spectrometer probe, MTP (moisture, temperature and pH) probes, near-infrared (NIR) and visual (VIS) cameras along
with their light sources.

Surface preparation module: If required, the surface preparation module cleans and prepares the surface
before sample collection.
